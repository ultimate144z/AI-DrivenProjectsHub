    "Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ever-evolving job market, staying ahead with the latest openings in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning can be quite the task. This project aims to streamline the job-hunting process, leveraging the power of automation with Selenium. By targeting popular job portals like rozee.pk and Indeed, we develop a script designed to navigate through the sea of listings, fetching pertinent details to aid in the job search. The technologies/libraries used are Selenium and Pandas. Furthermore, I am aware that this code might not be the best one, and that it isn't dynamic. However, I wanted to share it to show others that this is how I started web scraping. It isn't easy and dynamic stuff adds a layer of complexity, but you gotta do your best!"
